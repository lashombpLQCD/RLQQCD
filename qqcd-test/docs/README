========================
README for qqcd package.
========================

Typical use of these routines, is as follows:

1. Edit the files in the ./user directory.
2. Be sure your computer is included in ./sbin/compile .
3. Execute ./sbin/compile (from the main qqcd directory).
4. Execute one of: ./bin/translator
                   mpirun -np 12 ./bin/cfgsprops

--------


./glue/mpinull.f90 is an F-compatible nonfunctional replacement
for the true MPI module, useful for testing compilability.
NOTE: MPI calls are inherently not F compliant.
      These qqcd routines will compile with F and run in single processor mode
      if KR=KR2 in ./user/kinds
      For KR<>KR2, the two MPI calls in subroutine vecdot will need to be
      commented out before the codes will compile with F.
