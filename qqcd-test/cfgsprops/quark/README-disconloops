Here are some notes about the functions in disconloops.f90 in regard to
combining perturbative and eig subtraction methods.

1. generalaverage

   I think this function is what we need (should use) for computing the 
   first line in equations 4.84 and 4.87. We should make sure it is complete.
   It requires as an input the left and right eigenvecctors of the dirac 
   operator and the eigenvectors of the gamma5*Dirac operator. 

   This function calls nsaverage (non-subtracted average), eigaverage (eigen subtracted average),
   and average (perturbative subtracted average). I beleive the first task to make sure that 
   this part is well done and tested.


2. I think testFUNC is the function that plays the role of discon. I also think eigdiscon 
   should be the one called instead of testFUNC, but it looks like eigdiscon was not fully
   developed yet.  
  
   So, I recommend we prepare these two interface functions testFUNC and generalaverage, also 
   there will be a vev function later to come. This vev function will compute the second lines
   of equations 4.84 and 4.87. HOWEVER, the vev is independent of the noise and thus is not important
   when we look at the errors only. It is not implemented in the code now but will need to be 
   implemeneted to use this method in a physics computation.
